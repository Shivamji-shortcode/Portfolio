                <p>This was my first project. This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using linear regression. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful method used for predicting quantitative response variables. Here, we utilize it to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. <a href="https://github.com/Shivamji-shortcode/Linear-Regression-/blob/main/README.md">View Project</a></p>

                <p>This project aims to classify iris flowers into different species using logistic regression. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used for classification tasks. It contains measurements of various iris flowers, including the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the species of each flower.<a href="https://github.com/Shivamji-shortcode/Iris-Flower-Classification/blob/main/README.md">View Project</a></p>

                <h3>Abstract
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>INTRODUCTION: </b>Diabetic retinopathy is the name given to diabetes problems that harm the eyes. Its root cause is damage to the blood capillaries in the tissue that is light-sensitive in the rear of the eye. Over time, having excessive blood sugar may cause to the tiny blood capillaries that nourish the retina to become blocked, severing the retina's blood circulation. As a result, the eye tries to develop new blood arteries. <br>
                    
                    <b>OBJECTIVES: </b>The objective of this research is to analyse and compare various algorithms based on their performance and efficiency in predicting Diabetic Retinopathy. <br>
                    
                    <b>METHODS: </b>To achieve this, an experimental model was developed to predict Diabetic Retinopathy at early stage. <br>
                    
                    <b>RESULTS: </b>The results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and scalability of these algorithms. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of various algorithm selection and its impact on the overall performance of models. <br>
                    
                    <b>CONCLUSION: </b>The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of multiple algorithm selection and its impact on the overall performance of modelsâ€™ accuracy. By applying these algorithms, we can predict disease at early stage such that it can be cured efficiently before it goes worse.<a href="https://publications.eai.eu/index.php/IoT/article/view/5349">View</a></p>
